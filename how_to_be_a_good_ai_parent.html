<h3> The problem: </h3>
<p> 
    1. AI dramatically more powerful than what we have today is coming, and *soon*.
    <br>
    2. At a bare minimum, it will profoundly change employment, politics, and the mental development of children and adults
    <br>
    3. At worst, humans will completely lose control of our own future. And the well-being of the rest of the biosphere will be out of our control as well.
